## July 7th: Research + Schematic

Went through multiple open-source mini RC car projects' repos and videos like [Racer](https://github.com/StuckAtPrototype/Racer/) by [StuckAtPrototype](https://github.com/StuckAtPrototype)! After countless hours of searching online, I decided to use the **ESP32WROOM32** devkit as the main MCU. Then I made a list of the features I was planning on adding, and thus made a list of components! This project would require **2 separate PCBs**, one for the car and one for the remote. 

After that, I opened up **KiCAD** and made a project for the car's main board and added all the components required and (hopefully correctly) finished up routing the _battery-management-and-programming USB-C TP4056_ block!

There are a lot of components left unrouted, but will look at them tomorrow!

**Total time spent: 4 hours**

## July 8th: Schematic Completion

Routed all the parts left from yesterday and then added a laser (2-pin connector) and connected it using an NPN transistor (because I am going to use KY008, which runs on 5V, so it needed a direct connection from LiPo). Then added 4 3-pin connectors for the IR sensors and routed them all to the ESP32. I don't actually know right now if I am routing everything to the right pins on the MCU ðŸ« . Also added 3 LEDs for indicating lives remaining, and a live reset button to, well, reset lives! Also added _ESD protection_ on USB-C (had to look at a few schematics online to figure out how it's done ðŸ˜…). 

Finally, to make everything actually understandable and readable, I separated each part and placed all the components nicely, and then labelled each part and made a nice rectangle around it! Now it seems more professional!!

And then added an LED to know when the car is turned on!
