# RC Battle Car

I am designing a mini car controlled by a custom remote featuring a joystick and a button. The car can shoot lasers and has laser detectors to register damage. It will include headlights, taillights, and indicators for charging status (green for charged, red for charging).

The car runs on a LiPo battery and has three lights on top to represent its lives, with a switch for power and a button to reset lives when the car is picked up, showing when it has been defeated.

The remote will also operate on a LiPo battery, using an ESP32 as its MCU.

I need to design the PCB, 3D case, and firmware for both the remote and the car.
